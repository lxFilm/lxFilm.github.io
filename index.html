            <h2>Roblox Background</h2>
            <p>I started playing roblox back in 2013. I was basically a child and I would play to spend my time. I stopped playing in 2015 and started playing again back in 2018. During 2018 I started shifting roblox communities from childish ones to car communities on the platform. This helped me develop a sense of knowledge at scripting and understanding A-Chassis. During 2020, (March 8, 2020) me and a friend joined Club Iris. Which changed our entire aspect of Roblox. After entering such atmosphere, we had to change our ways of thinking to be able to survive in such toxic society. I lost most of my friends during this switch and I almost definitely regret it all. There is no going back and I cannot revert my life choices. I can only look straight and keep moving.</p>
